## Text review of the project (max 400 words):
Looking at EcoTracker from a user research and behavioral psychology perspective, the app addresses an important gap between environmental concern and actionable personal change. The user testing with 25 participants provides a good start, though a more diverse sample would strengthen insights.

The core challenge for this product is not technical implementation but behavior maintenance. Environmental apps typically see high initial engagement followed by rapid dropoff as the novelty fades and tracking becomes burdensome. The automatic tracking approach helps address this, but several behavioral principles could strengthen the design:

First, consider implementing variable reward schedules rather than predictable achievement badges. Research shows unpredictable rewards maintain engagement better than consistent ones. For example, occasional surprise recognitions for consistent behavior would be more effective than standard milestone achievements.

Second, the social comparison feature needs careful implementation. Social norm research shows comparisons can backfire for below-average performers, creating discouragement rather than motivation. I recommend implementing upward-only comparisons that show users how their efforts compare to slightly better performers rather than community-wide averages.

Third, the recommendation engine should incorporate implementation intention prompts. These "if-then" plans (e.g., "If it's not raining tomorrow morning, I'll bike to work") have been shown to significantly increase follow-through compared to general intentions. Allowing users to create these specific commitments would improve behavior change outcomes.

The current prototype seems to focus on rational decision-making, but environmental psychology research shows emotional connections and identity reinforcement are stronger motivators. Consider incorporating narrative elements that help users see themselves as "environmental stewards" or "climate innovators" rather than just focusing on metrics.

For ongoing engagement, habit stacking would be valuable - helping users attach new sustainable behaviors to existing routines. This concept from behavioral science has proven more effective than trying to establish entirely new habits.

Finally, consider how the app handles relapse. Most behavior change attempts include setbacks, and how the app responds to increased emissions after a period of reduction will significantly impact retention. A non-judgmental, growth-oriented approach that normalizes fluctuations would support long-term engagement.

Overall, EcoTracker shows promise but would benefit from deeper integration of behavioral science principles, particularly around habit formation, identity reinforcement, and long-term engagement strategies.
