## Project Name:
EcoTracker: Personal Carbon Footprint Management App

## Project Description (max 400 words):
EcoTracker is a mobile application designed to help individuals track, understand, and reduce their carbon footprint through data-driven insights and behavioral change techniques. The app addresses the growing consumer desire to make environmentally conscious choices by providing personalized, actionable information about the climate impact of daily activities.

The core functionality revolves around five key components:

1. **Automated Footprint Tracking:** Using a combination of smartphone sensors, location data, and integrations with common services (transport apps, utility accounts, shopping platforms), EcoTracker passively collects data on users' transportation methods, energy consumption, purchasing habits, and food choices.

2. **Impact Visualization:** The app translates complex carbon emissions data into intuitive visualizations, helping users understand their biggest impact areas and track progress over time. Users can see daily, weekly, and monthly breakdowns of their footprint across different categories.

3. **Personalized Recommendations:** Based on individual usage patterns, the app suggests personalized, achievable actions to reduce emissions. These range from simple swaps (e.g., suggesting nearby package-free stores) to longer-term changes (e.g., transitioning to renewable energy providers).

4. **Gamification Elements:** To maintain engagement, the app includes challenges, achievement badges, and a social comparison feature that allows users to anonymously compare their footprint to community averages or compete with friends.

5. **Offset Integration:** For emissions that cannot be eliminated, the app offers vetted carbon offset projects that users can contribute to directly through the platform, with transparent reporting on impact.

The app differentiates itself through its focus on behavioral science principles, using nudges and habit formation techniques to make sustainable choices easier and more appealing. Unlike existing footprint calculators that provide one-time assessments, EcoTracker creates a continuous feedback loop that reinforces positive changes and builds environmental consciousness over time.

Target users include environmentally concerned individuals between 25-45 years old who are digitally savvy and motivated to reduce their climate impact but may lack clear guidance on the most effective actions to take.

## Explain the work you've done so far:
We have developed a working prototype with the following components:

1. Core tracking functionality for transportation (using phone sensors to detect movement patterns), food (manual logging with barcode scanning), and home energy (manual input with utility bill scanning).

2. Initial data visualization dashboard showing daily and weekly carbon emissions across categories.

3. Basic recommendation engine that suggests actions based on identified high-impact areas.

4. User testing with 25 participants over two weeks, which provided feedback on accuracy, usability, and engagement factors.

5. Backend infrastructure for data processing and storage, with privacy-first architecture that keeps sensitive location data on-device.

Our primary challenges have been accurately estimating emissions for certain activities without making the input process burdensome for users. We're currently refining our algorithms based on test user feedback and exploring additional API integrations to reduce manual data entry requirements.
