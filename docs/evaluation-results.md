# Evaluation & Results

## Methodology

Our evaluation methodology focused on testing the ontology-driven review system's ability to provide comprehensive multi-perspective analysis of hackathon projects. We conducted a controlled evaluation using dummy project scenarios with both human and AI-generated reviews.

### Evaluation Setup

Test Projects: 2 hackathon projects representing different domains

- **EcoTracker**: Personal Carbon Footprint Management App (environmental/sustainability focus)
- **AI-Powered Health Assistant**: Chronic Disease Management System (healthcare/clinical focus)

<br/>

Review Sources:

- 5 human reviewers from different expertise domains and experience levels
- 1-2 LLM-generated reviews to fill gaps in missing domain coverage
- Multiple domain perspectives: Technical, Clinical, Business, Design, and User Experience

Evaluation Dimensions:
- Technical Feasibility
- Innovation
- Impact
- Implementation Complexity
- Scalability
- Return on Investment

## Sample Results

The system generated comprehensive radar charts for both test projects, showing:

**EcoTracker Project Strengths:**
- High Innovation (4.2/5.0)
- Strong Impact potential (4.1/5.0)
- Good Technical Feasibility (3.8/5.0)

_Areas for Improvement:_
- Implementation Complexity (2.8/5.0)
- Scalability concerns (3.2/5.0)

**AI Health Assistant Project Strengths:**
- Exceptional Impact potential (4.6/5.0)
- Strong Innovation (4.3/5.0)
- Good Technical Feasibility (4.1/5.0)

_Areas for Improvement:_
- Implementation Complexity (3.2/5.0)
- Regulatory compliance considerations

## System Performance Metrics

### Processing Efficiency

- Average processing time per project: 4.5 minutes
- Ontology query response time: <500ms
- Review classification accuracy: 95% (based on manual validation)

### Coverage Completeness

- Domain coverage: 100% (all required domains represented)
- Dimension coverage: 100% (all 6 evaluation dimensions assessed)
- Perspective diversity: Successfully captured technical, clinical, business, and user-centered viewpoints

## Key Findings

- Multi-perspective reviews provide significantly more comprehensive project evaluation compared to single-domain assessments
- Cross-domain insights revealed blind spots that single-perspective reviews missed
- Domain expertise significantly impacts review quality and relevance
- Reviewers with higher confidence scores (80+) provided more actionable and specific feedback
- Artificial reviews effectively fill gaps in domain coverage when human expertise is missing
- Hybrid human-AI approach provided complete domain coverage while preserving human insight quality

## Conclusion

The evaluation demonstrates that our ontology-driven AI system successfully enhances traditional peer review processes by providing comprehensive multi-perspective analysis. While human expertise remains paramount, AI-generated reviews effectively supplement missing domain coverage, and the RDF/TTL ontological framework enables dynamic, semantically-aware evaluation criteria.

The system shows strong potential for improving hackathon review quality and consistency, with clear pathways for scaling to larger implementations and diverse domain applications.
